Machine learning and statistics inference are similar 
(A case of computer science borrowing from a long history in statics)

In both cases , we are using data to learn / infer qualities of distribution that generated the data 
(Ofthen term the data generating process).

We may care either about the whole distribution or just features 
Machine learning application that focus on understanding parameters and individual effects involve nmore tools from statistical inference(Some application are focused only on result)

# Customer churn 
### Occuers when a customer leaves a company 

when we do not want to reduce the customer leving company so we want to reduce the churn rate 

Data related to churn will include a target variable for wheater not a customer has left athe compy 

Features could include 
- The length of time as customer
- the type and amount purchased
- other customer characteristics
Churn prediction is often appriached by predicting a score for individuals that estimates the probability the customer will leave

### Estimation of the factors driving customer churn involves measuring the impact each factor in predicting churn 
### Inference involves determininbg wheter these measured impacts are statistically significant
