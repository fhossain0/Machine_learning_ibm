# CI inside otf the barplots 
CI= confidence interval: Imagine you ask 10 people how much they like a product, and you get an average score (mean). But if you asked another 10 people, the average might be different.

The confidence interval shows a range around the average that says:

### when we plot bars for each category seaborn by default adds small lines (Error bards) on top of the bars 

parametric vs Non-parametric

If inferences is about trying to find out the data generating process (DGP)
then we can say that a statistical model of the data is a set of possible distributions or maybe even regressions

### parametric model is a particular type of statistical model : it is also a set of distribution or regressipon but they have a finite numbe rof parameters 

# None-parametric model 
- we make fewer assumptions
- in particular , we do not assume that the data belong to any particular distribution also called distribution free inference

An example of non-parametric is creating a distribution of the data (CDF or cumulative distribution function ) using a histogram

in this case , we are not specifying parameters 

# parametric models 
A parametric model is aparticular type of statistical model : it is a also a set of distribution or regression, but they have a finite number of parameters

An example of parametric model: the normal distribution

Example : customer lifetime value

Customer lifetime value is an extimate of the customer's value to the company 
Data releted to customer lifetime value migth include :
- The expected length of time aas a customer 
- the expected amount spent over time
