Estimation Vs inference
# Definition:
- Estimation is the process of calculating an approximate value of a population parameter (like mean, proportion, or standard deviation) based on sample data.
- Inference is the broader process of using sample data to draw conclusions or make decisions about a population, which includes estimation, hypothesis testing, and prediction. **statistical inference, we don’t just make an estimate, we also describe how accurate or reliable that estimate is. That’s where things like standard error and confidence intervals come in.**
